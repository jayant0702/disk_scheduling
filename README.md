#  Disk Scheduling Simulator

An interactive real-time web application that simulates and visualizes how various disk scheduling algorithms operate under different conditions. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project helps students, educators, and developers understand disk I/O management and scheduling strategies.

##  Project Purpose

The goal of this simulator is to:
- Visualize how disk head movement works
- Show how scheduling algorithms respond to changing request loads
- Demonstrate performance trade-offs like seek time and head movement
- Allow users to interactively control simulation speed and workload
- Provide an educational tool for operating system concepts
